# Aether Shades — Quiet Lens

**Open-source AR glasses that quietly reveal the truth.**  
No implants. No lies. Just vision.

Inspired by the moment you put on the glasses in *They Live* — but we don't scream "OBEY".  
We make deception feel... slightly off. Truth feels effortless.

### Features
- Ultra-light frames (24–32 g)
- Real-time tunable prescription (astigmatism, myopia — voice adjust)
- Subtle deception filter (tint pulses, sticky scroll, weight shifts)
- Standalone capable (no phone needed)
- 100% local processing — zero data harvest
- MIT licensed — build, modify, distribute freely

### Why Now
2025: Waveguides mature. LC lenses curve. On-device AI runs billion-parameter models.  
The cage is cracking. Time to see through it.

### Build Your Pair
- [BOM.md](BOM.md) — ~$320 parts
- [ASSEMBLY.md](ASSEMBLY.md) — No soldering, weekend project
- [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) — Where we're going

Prototype units live — December 2025.

Merry Christmas 2025. Let there be light. 🌌
